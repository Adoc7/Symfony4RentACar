  In order to prove that the Behat Symfony extension is correctly installed
  As a user
  I want to have a demo scenario

  Scenario: A user can access to home page
    When a user sends a request to "/"
    Then the status code should be "200"

  Scenario: An anonymous user cannot access to add car page
    When a user sends a request to "/car/add"
    Then the status code should be "302"
    Then i should be redirected to "/registration"

  Scenario: An anonymous user can see an announcement
    When a user sends a request to "/show/196"
    Then the status code should be "200"
    Then the page should contains "Votre voiture nÂ° 196"
    Then the page should contains "Marque : Voiture Admin"
    Then the page should contains "Prix : 2500 euros"
